âœ… In Java, a reference data type refers to an object.
âœ… Instead of holding actual data like primitive types, it stores the memory address (reference) where the object is located.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Points about Reference Types :

Created using class, interface, or array.
Memory is allocated in the Heap area.
Can be null (which means the reference is pointing to nothing).
Can reference custom objects, arrays, strings, collections, etc.
