☕ What is Static Typed Language?
Static typing means variable types are checked at compile-time (before the program runs).
You must declare the type of a variable explicitly or implicitly when writing code.
If you assign a wrong type, it gives a compile-time error — not a runtime error.



☕ What is Strong Typed Language?
Strong typing means a language does not allow mixing of different types without explicit conversion.
Type safety is strictly enforced.
You cannot automatically assign an integer to a string, or vice-versa, without manual conversion.
