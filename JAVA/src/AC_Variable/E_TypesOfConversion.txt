ðŸ“˜ 1. Widening Conversion (Automatic / Implicit Casting)

Smaller type â†’ Bigger type (no risk of data loss).
Done automatically by the Java compiler.
Also called upcasting.

From | To
byte | short, int, long, float, double
short | int, long, float, double
char | int, long, float, double
int | long, float, double
long | float, double
float | double






ðŸ“˜ 2. Narrowing Conversion (Manual / Explicit Casting)

Bigger type â†’ Smaller type (possible loss of data).
Must be done manually by the programmer using type casting.
Also called downcasting.

targetType variableName = (targetType) value;

From | To
double | float, long, int, short, byte, char
float | long, int, short, byte, char
long | int, short, byte, char
int | short, byte, char
short | byte, char
