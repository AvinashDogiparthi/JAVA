A RuntimeException is a type of unchecked exception ‚Äî it occurs during program execution (runtime)
and does not need to be declared or caught explicitly in code using throws or try-catch.


üîç Key Points:
It extends java.lang.RuntimeException, which is a subclass of java.lang.Exception.
Unlike checked exceptions, Java does not force you to handle runtime exceptions.
Mostly caused by programming errors like:
Invalid logic
Incorrect API usage
Null pointers
Bad casting
