✅ What is a Compile-Time Exception in Java?
A compile-time exception, also called a checked exception, is an exception that the Java compiler checks for during compilation.
If your code doesn't handle it (using try-catch) or declare it (throws), the code won’t compile.

| **Type**                         | Subclass of `Exception` (but **not** of `RuntimeException`)                |
| **Checked by compiler?**         | ✅ Yes                                                                      |
| **Must be handled or declared?** | ✅ Yes (`try-catch` or `throws`)                                            |
| **Caused by?**                   | External conditions: file not found, network errors, database issues, etc. |
| **Preventable at compile time?** | Often not — they deal with resources the code can’t control                |
