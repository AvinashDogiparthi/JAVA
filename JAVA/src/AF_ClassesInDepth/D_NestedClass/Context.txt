Class within another is called Nested Class

When to use ?
If you know that, a class A will be used only by class B, then instead of creating a new file for it.
We can create nested class inside B class itself.

Also it helps us to group logically related classes in one file

Scope :
Its scope is same as of its outer class

Types of Nested Class :
1) Static nested class
2) Non-Static nested class
