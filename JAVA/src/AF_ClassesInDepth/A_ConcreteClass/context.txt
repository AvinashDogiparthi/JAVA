âœ… A concrete class in Java is a regular class that:

Can be instantiated (you can create objects from it).
Implements all its methods completely.
Does NOT have any abstract methods left unimplemented.

ðŸ‘‰ In short: A class that is fully defined and can be used to create objects.
Ex : Dog class in this package


âœ… When a class implements an interface and defines all methods, it becomes a concrete class.
Car class in this package
