We cannot change the value of an object once it is created
Declare class as "final" so that it cannot be extended
All class members should be private. So that direct access can be avoided
Class members are initialized only using constructor
There should not be any setter methods, which is generally used to change value

just getter methods and returns copy of the member variable
