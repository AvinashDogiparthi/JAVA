A class that is derived from another class is Sub class, and from which it is derived is Super class.

In JAVA, in the absence of any other explicit super class every class is implicitly a sub class of Object class.
Object is the top most class in JAVA.

It has some common methods like clone(), toString(), equals(), finalize(), wait(), notify(), etc.
