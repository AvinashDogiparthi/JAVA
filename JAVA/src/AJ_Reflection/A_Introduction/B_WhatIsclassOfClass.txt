Instance of the class Class represents classes during run-time.

JVM created one class object for each and every class which is loaded during run-time.
This class Object, has meta data information about the particular class like its method, fields, constructor etc


How to get particular class Class Object

There are three ways :


1) using forName() method :

    class Bird {}
    class birdClass =Class.forName("Bird");


2) Using .class :

   class Bird {}
   class birdClass = Bird.class


3) Using getClass() method :

    Bird birdObj = new Bird();
    class birdClass = birdObj.getClass();
