✅ Priority Queue in Java: An In-Depth Explanation



✅ What is a Priority Queue?
A Priority Queue is a type of queue where each element has a priority.
Elements with higher priority are served before elements with lower priority.
It is part of the Java Collections Framework and is available in the java.util package.


✅ How Priority Queue Works:
Internally, PriorityQueue is implemented using a Binary Heap (Min-Heap by default).


By default:
It is a Min-Heap, meaning the smallest element is at the front.
Elements are ordered in natural order (Comparable) if they are of a type that implements Comparable.
If a custom order (Comparator) is provided, it follows that order.
