✅ Natural Ordering in Priority Queue:
Natural Ordering means the order defined by the elements themselves.


Any class used in PriorityQueue must:
Implement the Comparable<T> interface.
Override the compareTo method.


✅ Example of Natural Ordering:
For integers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (Ascending Order).
For strings: "Apple", "Banana", "Cherry" (Lexicographical Order).


✅ How Natural Ordering Works Internally:
PriorityQueue uses the compareTo method of elements:
a.compareTo(b) < 0 → a has higher priority than b.
a.compareTo(b) > 0 → b has higher priority than a.
