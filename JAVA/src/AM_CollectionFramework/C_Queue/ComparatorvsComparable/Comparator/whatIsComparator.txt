What is Comparator?
Comparator is also an interface in Java (java.util.Comparator).
It is used to define multiple sorting orders for a class.
Sorting logic is defined outside the class.
Allows sorting using custom rules without changing the class code.

âœ… How it works:
A separate class or lambda expression is used to define the Comparator.
Multiple Comparators can be defined for different sorting criteria.
