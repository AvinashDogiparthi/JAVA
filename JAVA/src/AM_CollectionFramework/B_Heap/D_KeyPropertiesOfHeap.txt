Efficient Access :

Root element ( max or min ) is always at top
Access Time : O(1)



Insertion and Deletion :

Always happen at the last level ( left to right ) to maintain complete tree
Insertion time : O(log N ) ( because of heapify )
Deletion Time : O(log N) ( only root can be deleted, and then re-heapifier)
