âœ… Why Heap over other Data Structures?
Unlike arrays (O(n) for min/max) and sorted arrays (O(n) for insertion), a heap maintains both fast insertion and fast access to min/max.

Compared to a balanced binary search tree (BST):
Heap is faster for min/max (O(1) vs O(log n)).
Heap does not maintain full order but focuses on the min/max.
