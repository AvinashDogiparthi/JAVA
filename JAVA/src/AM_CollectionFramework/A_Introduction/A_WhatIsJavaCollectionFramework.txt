Added in the java version 1.2
Collections is nothing but a group of objects
Present in java.util package
Framework provides us the architecture to manage these "group of objects" i.e., add, update, delete, search


Why we need JAVA collection framework ?

Prior to java collections framework, we have array, vector and hashtables
But problem with that is there is not common interface. So it is difficult to rememeber the method for each



Now with JAVA collection framework, all collections are the child classes of collection, So, they share similar methods to perform the operations
Instead we have to focus on code logic



java.lang.Iterable  (root interface)
        |
        +-- java.util.Collection<E>
                 |
                 +-- java.util.List<E>
                 |      +-- ArrayList
                 |      +-- LinkedList
                 |      +-- Vector
                 |           +-- Stack
                 |
                 +-- java.util.Set<E>
                 |      +-- HashSet
                 |      |     +-- LinkedHashSet
                 |      +-- TreeSet (implements NavigableSet)
                 |
                 +-- java.util.Queue<E>
                        +-- LinkedList (also List)
                        +-- PriorityQueue
                        +-- ArrayDeque

java.util.Map<K, V>  (not part of Collection but related)
        +-- HashMap
        |     +-- LinkedHashMap
        +-- TreeMap (implements NavigableMap)
        +-- Hashtable
              +-- Properties
