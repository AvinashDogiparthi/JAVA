Fields are public, static and final implicitly
You cannot make field private (or) protected

Overriding method cannot have more restrict access specifiers
Concrete class must override all the methods declared in the interface

Abstract classes are not forced to override all the methods
A class can implement from multiple interface which solves diamond problem in OOPs
