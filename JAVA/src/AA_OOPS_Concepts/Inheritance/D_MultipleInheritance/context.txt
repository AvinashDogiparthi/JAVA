Multiple Inheritance means a class inherits from more than one parent.

🔴 Java Limitation (Important!)
Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes to avoid ambiguity (like the Diamond Problem).

However, Java does support multiple inheritance with interfaces ✅.



✅ Solution: Use Interfaces for Multiple Inheritance
In Java, a class can implement multiple interfaces.
