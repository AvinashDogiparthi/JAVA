# Java Thread Joining – A Complete Guide

Java provides the `Thread.join()` method to coordinate thread execution and ensure that one thread waits for another to finish before proceeding. This is essential in multi-threaded applications where the execution order matters or when you need the main thread to wait for background tasks to complete.

---

## 🧠 What is `Thread.join()`?

`Thread.join()` is a method that causes the **current thread** (the one that calls `join()`) to **pause execution** until the thread on which it was called **finishes**.

```java
Thread t = new Thread(() -> {
    // Task here
});
t.start();
t.join(); // Current thread (e.g., main) waits for t to finish
```

---

## 🚦 Why Use `join()`?

- To coordinate execution order between threads
- To ensure the main or parent thread waits for child threads to complete
- To prevent race conditions or incomplete work due to early termination

## 🔍 JVM Lifecycle vs `join()`

| Concept                | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| JVM shutdown behavior | JVM waits for all **non-daemon** threads to complete before exiting         |
| `join()` method        | Makes **one thread** explicitly wait for **another** to finish execution   |

Even though the JVM naturally waits for non-daemon threads, `join()` is useful for controlling the program's execution flow.

---

## 📌 Basic Example

```java
public class JoinExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Thread 1 running");
        });

        t1.start();
        t1.join(); // Wait for t1 to finish

        System.out.println("Main thread resumes after t1");
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Thread 1 running
Main thread resumes after t1
```

---

## ⛓️ Join with Multiple Threads

```java
public class MultiJoinExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            try { Thread.sleep(500); } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {}
            System.out.println("Thread 1 done");
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            try { Thread.sleep(300); } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {}
            System.out.println("Thread 2 done");
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join(); // Wait for t1 to complete
        t2.join(); // Wait for t2 to complete

        System.out.println("Main thread resumes after both threads");
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Thread 2 done
Thread 1 done
Main thread resumes after both threads
```

## ⏱️ Using `join()` with Timeout

You can specify a timeout (in milliseconds) when calling join:

```java
t1.join(1000); // Waits up to 1 second for t1 to finish
```

If the thread does not finish in the given time, execution continues anyway.

---

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

- Calling `join()` on a thread that never finishes (e.g., infinite loop) will block indefinitely.
- `join()` works on both daemon and non-daemon threads, but the JVM only waits for non-daemon threads to finish before exiting.
- Always handle `InterruptedException` when calling `join()`.

---

## 🧵 `join()` vs Daemon Threads

```java
Thread t = new Thread(() -> {
    while (true) {
        // Infinite task
    }
});
t.setDaemon(true); // Set as daemon
t.start();
t.join(); // This may not complete, as JVM may exit early
```

Note: Even with `join()`, the JVM can terminate if only daemon threads are left.

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Use `join()` when you need deterministic execution order between threads.
- Avoid using `join()` on long-running or indefinite threads.
- Use `ExecutorService`, `Future`, or `CountDownLatch` for complex thread coordination.

---

## 🧪 Real-World Use Case

Use Case: You start two background threads to fetch and process data. You want the main thread to generate a report only after both threads finish.

```java
Thread fetchData = new Thread(() -> {
    // Simulate DB fetch
});
Thread processData = new Thread(() -> {
    // Simulate processing
});

fetchData.start();
processData.start();

fetchData.join();
processData.join();

System.out.println("All tasks done. Generate report.");
```
