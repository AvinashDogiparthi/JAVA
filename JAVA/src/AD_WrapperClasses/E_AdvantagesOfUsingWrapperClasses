1️⃣ They allow primitives to be used where only objects are allowed

✅ Many Java APIs, libraries, and data structures only work with objects, not primitive types.
✅ Example:
Collections like ArrayList, HashMap, etc., can store objects but cannot store primitives.

Example:
ArrayList<int> list = new ArrayList<>();   // ❌ Not allowed (primitive)
ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();  // ✅ Wrapper class
✅ So, wrapper classes make it possible to use primitives inside collections.







2️⃣ Autoboxing and Unboxing makes code simpler
✅ Since Java 5, you can automatically convert between primitives and wrapper objects without writing manual code.

Example:
Integer a = 10;   // Autoboxing
int b = a;        // Unboxing
✅ This saves coding effort and makes code cleaner and readable.








3️⃣ Wrapper classes provide useful utility methods
✅ Wrapper classes come with built-in methods for conversion, parsing, etc.

Example:

String s = "123";
int num = Integer.parseInt(s);  // converts String to int
✅ Integer.parseInt(), Double.parseDouble(), Boolean.parseBoolean(), etc.,
✅ These are very useful for real-world programming!




4️⃣ They allow Null Values (Optional Values)
✅ Wrapper objects can be null, primitives cannot.

✅ Useful when you need to represent absence of value in variables, objects, databases, etc.

Example:
Integer salary = null;  // allowed
int salary = null;      // ❌ Error
✅ Helps in cases like optional fields in database operations.





5️⃣ They make generic programming possible
✅ In Java Generics (<T>), only objects are allowed.

✅ Because wrapper classes turn primitives into objects,
you can create generic code that works with primitive-like data.

Example:
ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
ArrayList<Double> rates = new ArrayList<>();
✅ Otherwise, Generics would not work with int, double, etc.






6️⃣ They support Immutability
✅ Wrapper objects are immutable, meaning once created, their value cannot be changed.
✅ This immutability makes wrapper classes:

Thread-safe

Predictable

Useful for caching (especially in case of Integer values from -128 to 127)
