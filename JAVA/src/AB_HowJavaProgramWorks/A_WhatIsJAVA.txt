Portability [ W O R A ] : Write Once, Run Anywhere

🌟 What is WORA in Java?
WORA means:
You write Java code once on any platform (Windows, Mac, Linux).
You can run the same compiled code anywhere without changing it.
You don't need to rewrite or recompile the program for every machine.




✅ This is possible because of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).



🔥 How it Works Step-by-Step

You write .java source code.
Java compiler (javac) compiles it into .class bytecode.
Bytecode is platform-independent — not tied to any OS.
JVM (specific to each OS) interprets/executes the bytecode on the target machine.
