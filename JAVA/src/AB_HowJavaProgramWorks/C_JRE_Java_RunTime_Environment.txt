JRE is a software package that provides everything needed to run a Java program.

It does NOT contain tools to develop Java programs (like javac compiler) ‚Äî it is only for running Java applications.

‚úÖ In short:
If you want to run Java programs ‚Üí you need JRE.
If you want to develop Java programs ‚Üí you need JDK.



Part | Purpose
JVM (Java Virtual Machine) | To execute bytecode
Set of Libraries | Pre-built Java class libraries (java.lang, java.util, etc.)
Other supporting files | Configuration files, property files, fonts, security policy files, etc.




üíª Flow of a Java Program Using JRE

1. Developer compiles Hello.java ‚Üí Hello.class (bytecode).
2. User has JRE installed on their system.
3. JVM inside JRE reads Hello.class.
4. JVM executes it with help of Java libraries.
5. Output is shown on the console.


üõ†Ô∏è Where is JRE Installed?
When you install Java JDK, it automatically installs JRE inside it.
You can also install only JRE separately if you just want to run Java apps, not develop.
‚úÖ For example: if you're running Minecraft (built on Java), you need JRE only!
