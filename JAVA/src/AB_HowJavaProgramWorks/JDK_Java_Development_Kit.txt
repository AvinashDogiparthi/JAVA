JDK is a software development kit (SDK) specifically for Java.

It provides everything you need to develop, compile, debug, and run Java applications.

It includes:

JRE (Java Runtime Environment) → to run Java programs

Development tools like javac (compiler), javadoc, jar tools, etc.

✅ If you are only running Java apps → you just need JRE.
✅ If you are developing Java apps → you must install JDK.
